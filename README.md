# MERN-for-Production

A template of sorts I made as a starting point for my MERN app projects. It's set up for Docker, MongoDB Atlas, and Digital Ocean. It also now includes authetication support using Firebase auth! The styling (currently minimal) is handled with tailwindcss.

Currently Adding: MobX support
